# Why use hooks?

The goal of pre-commit hooks is to improve the quality of commits. This is
achieved by making sure your commits meet some (formal) requirements, e.g:

- that they comply to a certain coding style (with the hook `style-files`).

- that you commit derivatives such as `README.md` or `.Rd` files with their
  source instead of spreading them over multiple commits.

- and so on.

As all changes enter a repository history with a commit, we believe many checks
should be performed at that point, and not only later on a CI service. For
example, creating auto-commits at a CI service for styling code creates
unnecessary extra commits, as styling can be checked at the time of committing
and is relatively inexpensive.

# Why use the pre-commit framework?

Implementing hooks in a framework such as
[pre-commit.com](https://pre-commit.com) has multiple benefits compared to using simple bash scripts in `.git/hooks`:

* Easily use hooks other people have created, in bash, R, python and other languages.
  There are a wealth of useful hooks available, most listed
  [here](https://pre-commit.com/hooks.html). For example,
  `check-added-large-files` prevents you from committing big files, other hooks
  validate json or yaml files and so on.

* No need to worry about dependencies, testing, different versions of hooks,
  file filtering for specific hooks etc. It's all handled by pre-commit.

* Hooks are maintained in *one* place, and you just need a
  `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file. No need to c/p hooks from one project to
  another.
